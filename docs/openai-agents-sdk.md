Quickstart
Create a project and virtual environment
You'll only need to do this once.


mkdir my_project
cd my_project
python -m venv .venv
Activate the virtual environment
Do this every time you start a new terminal session.


source .venv/bin/activate
Install the Agents SDK

pip install openai-agents # or `uv add openai-agents`, etc
Set an OpenAI API key
If you don't have one, follow these instructions to create an OpenAI API key.


export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
Create your first agent
Agents are defined with instructions, a name, and optional config (such as model_config)


from agents import Agent

agent = Agent(
    name="Math Tutor",
    instructions="You provide help with math problems. Explain your reasoning at each step and include examples",
)
Add a few more agents
Additional agents can be defined in the same way. handoff_descriptions provide additional context for determining handoff routing


from agents import Agent

history_tutor_agent = Agent(
    name="History Tutor",
    handoff_description="Specialist agent for historical questions",
    instructions="You provide assistance with historical queries. Explain important events and context clearly.",
)

math_tutor_agent = Agent(
    name="Math Tutor",
    handoff_description="Specialist agent for math questions",
    instructions="You provide help with math problems. Explain your reasoning at each step and include examples",
)
Define your handoffs
On each agent, you can define an inventory of outgoing handoff options that the agent can choose from to decide how to make progress on their task.


triage_agent = Agent(
    name="Triage Agent",
    instructions="You determine which agent to use based on the user's homework question",
    handoffs=[history_tutor_agent, math_tutor_agent]
)
Run the agent orchestration
Let's check that the workflow runs and the triage agent correctly routes between the two specialist agents.


from agents import Runner

async def main():
    result = await Runner.run(triage_agent, "What is the capital of France?")
    print(result.final_output)
Add a guardrail
You can define custom guardrails to run on the input or output.


from agents import GuardrailFunctionOutput, Agent, Runner
from pydantic import BaseModel


class HomeworkOutput(BaseModel):
    is_homework: bool
    reasoning: str

guardrail_agent = Agent(
    name="Guardrail check",
    instructions="Check if the user is asking about homework.",
    output_type=HomeworkOutput,
)

async def homework_guardrail(ctx, agent, input_data):
    result = await Runner.run(guardrail_agent, input_data, context=ctx.context)
    final_output = result.final_output_as(HomeworkOutput)
    return GuardrailFunctionOutput(
        output_info=final_output,
        tripwire_triggered=not final_output.is_homework,
    )
Put it all together
Let's put it all together and run the entire workflow, using handoffs and the input guardrail.


from agents import Agent, InputGuardrail, GuardrailFunctionOutput, Runner
from agents.exceptions import InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered
from pydantic import BaseModel
import asyncio

class HomeworkOutput(BaseModel):
    is_homework: bool
    reasoning: str

guardrail_agent = Agent(
    name="Guardrail check",
    instructions="Check if the user is asking about homework.",
    output_type=HomeworkOutput,
)

math_tutor_agent = Agent(
    name="Math Tutor",
    handoff_description="Specialist agent for math questions",
    instructions="You provide help with math problems. Explain your reasoning at each step and include examples",
)

history_tutor_agent = Agent(
    name="History Tutor",
    handoff_description="Specialist agent for historical questions",
    instructions="You provide assistance with historical queries. Explain important events and context clearly.",
)


async def homework_guardrail(ctx, agent, input_data):
    result = await Runner.run(guardrail_agent, input_data, context=ctx.context)
    final_output = result.final_output_as(HomeworkOutput)
    return GuardrailFunctionOutput(
        output_info=final_output,
        tripwire_triggered=not final_output.is_homework,
    )

triage_agent = Agent(
    name="Triage Agent",
    instructions="You determine which agent to use based on the user's homework question",
    handoffs=[history_tutor_agent, math_tutor_agent],
    input_guardrails=[
        InputGuardrail(guardrail_function=homework_guardrail),
    ],
)

async def main():
    # Example 1: History question
    try:
        result = await Runner.run(triage_agent, "who was the first president of the united states?")
        print(result.final_output)
    except InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered as e:
        print("Guardrail blocked this input:", e)

    # Example 2: General/philosophical question
    try:
        result = await Runner.run(triage_agent, "What is the meaning of life?")
        print(result.final_output)
    except InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered as e:
        print("Guardrail blocked this input:", e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())

    Sessions
The Agents SDK provides built-in session memory to automatically maintain conversation history across multiple agent runs, eliminating the need to manually handle .to_input_list() between turns.

Sessions stores conversation history for a specific session, allowing agents to maintain context without requiring explicit manual memory management. This is particularly useful for building chat applications or multi-turn conversations where you want the agent to remember previous interactions.

Quick start

from agents import Agent, Runner, SQLiteSession

# Create agent
agent = Agent(
    name="Assistant",
    instructions="Reply very concisely.",
)

# Create a session instance with a session ID
session = SQLiteSession("conversation_123")

# First turn
result = await Runner.run(
    agent,
    "What city is the Golden Gate Bridge in?",
    session=session
)
print(result.final_output)  # "San Francisco"

# Second turn - agent automatically remembers previous context
result = await Runner.run(
    agent,
    "What state is it in?",
    session=session
)
print(result.final_output)  # "California"

# Also works with synchronous runner
result = Runner.run_sync(
    agent,
    "What's the population?",
    session=session
)
print(result.final_output)  # "Approximately 39 million"
How it works
When session memory is enabled:

Before each run: The runner automatically retrieves the conversation history for the session and prepends it to the input items.
After each run: All new items generated during the run (user input, assistant responses, tool calls, etc.) are automatically stored in the session.
Context preservation: Each subsequent run with the same session includes the full conversation history, allowing the agent to maintain context.
This eliminates the need to manually call .to_input_list() and manage conversation state between runs.

Memory operations
Basic operations
Sessions supports several operations for managing conversation history:


from agents import SQLiteSession

session = SQLiteSession("user_123", "conversations.db")

# Get all items in a session
items = await session.get_items()

# Add new items to a session
new_items = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi there!"}
]
await session.add_items(new_items)

# Remove and return the most recent item
last_item = await session.pop_item()
print(last_item)  # {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi there!"}

# Clear all items from a session
await session.clear_session()
Using pop_item for corrections
The pop_item method is particularly useful when you want to undo or modify the last item in a conversation:


from agents import Agent, Runner, SQLiteSession

agent = Agent(name="Assistant")
session = SQLiteSession("correction_example")

# Initial conversation
result = await Runner.run(
    agent,
    "What's 2 + 2?",
    session=session
)
print(f"Agent: {result.final_output}")

# User wants to correct their question
assistant_item = await session.pop_item()  # Remove agent's response
user_item = await session.pop_item()  # Remove user's question

# Ask a corrected question
result = await Runner.run(
    agent,
    "What's 2 + 3?",
    session=session
)
print(f"Agent: {result.final_output}")
Session types
The SDK provides several session implementations for different use cases:

OpenAI Conversations API sessions
Use OpenAI's Conversations API through OpenAIConversationsSession.


from agents import Agent, Runner, OpenAIConversationsSession

# Create agent
agent = Agent(
    name="Assistant",
    instructions="Reply very concisely.",
)

# Create a new conversation
session = OpenAIConversationsSession()

# Optionally resume a previous conversation by passing a conversation ID
# session = OpenAIConversationsSession(conversation_id="conv_123")

# Start conversation
result = await Runner.run(
    agent,
    "What city is the Golden Gate Bridge in?",
    session=session
)
print(result.final_output)  # "San Francisco"

# Continue the conversation
result = await Runner.run(
    agent,
    "What state is it in?",
    session=session
)
print(result.final_output)  # "California"
SQLite sessions
The default, lightweight session implementation using SQLite:


from agents import SQLiteSession

# In-memory database (lost when process ends)
session = SQLiteSession("user_123")

# Persistent file-based database
session = SQLiteSession("user_123", "conversations.db")

# Use the session
result = await Runner.run(
    agent,
    "Hello",
    session=session
)
SQLAlchemy sessions
Production-ready sessions using any SQLAlchemy-supported database:


from agents.extensions.memory import SQLAlchemySession

# Using database URL
session = SQLAlchemySession.from_url(
    "user_123",
    url="postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@localhost/db",
    create_tables=True
)

# Using existing engine
from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import create_async_engine
engine = create_async_engine("postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@localhost/db")
session = SQLAlchemySession("user_123", engine=engine, create_tables=True)
See SQLAlchemy Sessions for detailed documentation.

Advanced SQLite sessions
Enhanced SQLite sessions with conversation branching, usage analytics, and structured queries:


from agents.extensions.memory import AdvancedSQLiteSession

# Create with advanced features
session = AdvancedSQLiteSession(
    session_id="user_123",
    db_path="conversations.db",
    create_tables=True
)

# Automatic usage tracking
result = await Runner.run(agent, "Hello", session=session)
await session.store_run_usage(result)  # Track token usage

# Conversation branching
await session.create_branch_from_turn(2)  # Branch from turn 2
See Advanced SQLite Sessions for detailed documentation.

Encrypted sessions
Transparent encryption wrapper for any session implementation:


from agents.extensions.memory import EncryptedSession, SQLAlchemySession

# Create underlying session
underlying_session = SQLAlchemySession.from_url(
    "user_123",
    url="sqlite+aiosqlite:///conversations.db",
    create_tables=True
)

# Wrap with encryption and TTL
session = EncryptedSession(
    session_id="user_123",
    underlying_session=underlying_session,
    encryption_key="your-secret-key",
    ttl=600  # 10 minutes
)

result = await Runner.run(agent, "Hello", session=session)
See Encrypted Sessions for detailed documentation.

Other session types
There are a few more built-in options. Please refer to examples/memory/ and source code under extensions/memory/.

Session management
Session ID naming
Use meaningful session IDs that help you organize conversations:

User-based: "user_12345"
Thread-based: "thread_abc123"
Context-based: "support_ticket_456"
Memory persistence
Use in-memory SQLite (SQLiteSession("session_id")) for temporary conversations
Use file-based SQLite (SQLiteSession("session_id", "path/to/db.sqlite")) for persistent conversations
Use SQLAlchemy-powered sessions (SQLAlchemySession("session_id", engine=engine, create_tables=True)) for production systems with existing databases supported by SQLAlchemy
Use Dapr state store sessions (DaprSession.from_address("session_id", state_store_name="statestore", dapr_address="localhost:50001")) for production cloud-native deployments with support for 30+ database backends with built-in telemetry, tracing, and data isolation
Use OpenAI-hosted storage (OpenAIConversationsSession()) when you prefer to store history in the OpenAI Conversations API
Use encrypted sessions (EncryptedSession(session_id, underlying_session, encryption_key)) to wrap any session with transparent encryption and TTL-based expiration
Consider implementing custom session backends for other production systems (Redis, Django, etc.) for more advanced use cases
Multiple sessions

from agents import Agent, Runner, SQLiteSession

agent = Agent(name="Assistant")

# Different sessions maintain separate conversation histories
session_1 = SQLiteSession("user_123", "conversations.db")
session_2 = SQLiteSession("user_456", "conversations.db")

result1 = await Runner.run(
    agent,
    "Help me with my account",
    session=session_1
)
result2 = await Runner.run(
    agent,
    "What are my charges?",
    session=session_2
)
Session sharing

# Different agents can share the same session
support_agent = Agent(name="Support")
billing_agent = Agent(name="Billing")
session = SQLiteSession("user_123")

# Both agents will see the same conversation history
result1 = await Runner.run(
    support_agent,
    "Help me with my account",
    session=session
)
result2 = await Runner.run(
    billing_agent,
    "What are my charges?",
    session=session
)
Complete example
Here's a complete example showing session memory in action:


import asyncio
from agents import Agent, Runner, SQLiteSession


async def main():
    # Create an agent
    agent = Agent(
        name="Assistant",
        instructions="Reply very concisely.",
    )

    # Create a session instance that will persist across runs
    session = SQLiteSession("conversation_123", "conversation_history.db")

    print("=== Sessions Example ===")
    print("The agent will remember previous messages automatically.\n")

    # First turn
    print("First turn:")
    print("User: What city is the Golden Gate Bridge in?")
    result = await Runner.run(
        agent,
        "What city is the Golden Gate Bridge in?",
        session=session
    )
    print(f"Assistant: {result.final_output}")
    print()

    # Second turn - the agent will remember the previous conversation
    print("Second turn:")
    print("User: What state is it in?")
    result = await Runner.run(
        agent,
        "What state is it in?",
        session=session
    )
    print(f"Assistant: {result.final_output}")
    print()

    # Third turn - continuing the conversation
    print("Third turn:")
    print("User: What's the population of that state?")
    result = await Runner.run(
        agent,
        "What's the population of that state?",
        session=session
    )
    print(f"Assistant: {result.final_output}")
    print()

    print("=== Conversation Complete ===")
    print("Notice how the agent remembered the context from previous turns!")
    print("Sessions automatically handles conversation history.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Custom session implementations
You can implement your own session memory by creating a class that follows the Session protocol:


from agents.memory.session import SessionABC
from agents.items import TResponseInputItem
from typing import List

class MyCustomSession(SessionABC):
    """Custom session implementation following the Session protocol."""

    def __init__(self, session_id: str):
        self.session_id = session_id
        # Your initialization here

    async def get_items(self, limit: int | None = None) -> List[TResponseInputItem]:
        """Retrieve conversation history for this session."""
        # Your implementation here
        pass

    async def add_items(self, items: List[TResponseInputItem]) -> None:
        """Store new items for this session."""
        # Your implementation here
        pass

    async def pop_item(self) -> TResponseInputItem | None:
        """Remove and return the most recent item from this session."""
        # Your implementation here
        pass

    async def clear_session(self) -> None:
        """Clear all items for this session."""
        # Your implementation here
        pass

# Use your custom session
agent = Agent(name="Assistant")
result = await Runner.run(
    agent,
    "Hello",
    session=MyCustomSession("my_session")
)




=====


Tools
Tools let agents take actions: things like fetching data, running code, calling external APIs, and even using a computer. There are three classes of tools in the Agent SDK:

Hosted tools: these run on LLM servers alongside the AI models. OpenAI offers retrieval, web search and computer use as hosted tools.
Function calling: these allow you to use any Python function as a tool.
Agents as tools: this allows you to use an agent as a tool, allowing Agents to call other agents without handing off to them.
Hosted tools
OpenAI offers a few built-in tools when using the OpenAIResponsesModel:

The WebSearchTool lets an agent search the web.
The FileSearchTool allows retrieving information from your OpenAI Vector Stores.
The ComputerTool allows automating computer use tasks.
The CodeInterpreterTool lets the LLM execute code in a sandboxed environment.
The HostedMCPTool exposes a remote MCP server's tools to the model.
The ImageGenerationTool generates images from a prompt.
The LocalShellTool runs shell commands on your machine.

from agents import Agent, FileSearchTool, Runner, WebSearchTool

agent = Agent(
    name="Assistant",
    tools=[
        WebSearchTool(),
        FileSearchTool(
            max_num_results=3,
            vector_store_ids=["VECTOR_STORE_ID"],
        ),
    ],
)

async def main():
    result = await Runner.run(agent, "Which coffee shop should I go to, taking into account my preferences and the weather today in SF?")
    print(result.final_output)
Function tools
You can use any Python function as a tool. The Agents SDK will setup the tool automatically:

The name of the tool will be the name of the Python function (or you can provide a name)
Tool description will be taken from the docstring of the function (or you can provide a description)
The schema for the function inputs is automatically created from the function's arguments
Descriptions for each input are taken from the docstring of the function, unless disabled
We use Python's inspect module to extract the function signature, along with griffe to parse docstrings and pydantic for schema creation.


import json

from typing_extensions import TypedDict, Any

from agents import Agent, FunctionTool, RunContextWrapper, function_tool


class Location(TypedDict):
    lat: float
    long: float

@function_tool  
async def fetch_weather(location: Location) -> str:
    
    """Fetch the weather for a given location.

    Args:
        location: The location to fetch the weather for.
    """
    # In real life, we'd fetch the weather from a weather API
    return "sunny"


@function_tool(name_override="fetch_data")  
def read_file(ctx: RunContextWrapper[Any], path: str, directory: str | None = None) -> str:
    """Read the contents of a file.

    Args:
        path: The path to the file to read.
        directory: The directory to read the file from.
    """
    # In real life, we'd read the file from the file system
    return "<file contents>"


agent = Agent(
    name="Assistant",
    tools=[fetch_weather, read_file],  
)

for tool in agent.tools:
    if isinstance(tool, FunctionTool):
        print(tool.name)
        print(tool.description)
        print(json.dumps(tool.params_json_schema, indent=2))
        print()
Expand to see output
Returning images or files from function tools
In addition to returning text outputs, you can return one or many images or files as the output of a function tool. To do so, you can return any of:

Images: ToolOutputImage (or the TypedDict version, ToolOutputImageDict)
Files: ToolOutputFileContent (or the TypedDict version, ToolOutputFileContentDict)
Text: either a string or stringable objects, or ToolOutputText (or the TypedDict version, ToolOutputTextDict)
Custom function tools
Sometimes, you don't want to use a Python function as a tool. You can directly create a FunctionTool if you prefer. You'll need to provide:

name
description
params_json_schema, which is the JSON schema for the arguments
on_invoke_tool, which is an async function that receives a ToolContext and the arguments as a JSON string, and must return the tool output as a string.

from typing import Any

from pydantic import BaseModel

from agents import RunContextWrapper, FunctionTool



def do_some_work(data: str) -> str:
    return "done"


class FunctionArgs(BaseModel):
    username: str
    age: int


async def run_function(ctx: RunContextWrapper[Any], args: str) -> str:
    parsed = FunctionArgs.model_validate_json(args)
    return do_some_work(data=f"{parsed.username} is {parsed.age} years old")


tool = FunctionTool(
    name="process_user",
    description="Processes extracted user data",
    params_json_schema=FunctionArgs.model_json_schema(),
    on_invoke_tool=run_function,
)
Automatic argument and docstring parsing
As mentioned before, we automatically parse the function signature to extract the schema for the tool, and we parse the docstring to extract descriptions for the tool and for individual arguments. Some notes on that:

The signature parsing is done via the inspect module. We use type annotations to understand the types for the arguments, and dynamically build a Pydantic model to represent the overall schema. It supports most types, including Python primitives, Pydantic models, TypedDicts, and more.
We use griffe to parse docstrings. Supported docstring formats are google, sphinx and numpy. We attempt to automatically detect the docstring format, but this is best-effort and you can explicitly set it when calling function_tool. You can also disable docstring parsing by setting use_docstring_info to False.
The code for the schema extraction lives in agents.function_schema.

Agents as tools
In some workflows, you may want a central agent to orchestrate a network of specialized agents, instead of handing off control. You can do this by modeling agents as tools.


from agents import Agent, Runner
import asyncio

spanish_agent = Agent(
    name="Spanish agent",
    instructions="You translate the user's message to Spanish",
)

french_agent = Agent(
    name="French agent",
    instructions="You translate the user's message to French",
)

orchestrator_agent = Agent(
    name="orchestrator_agent",
    instructions=(
        "You are a translation agent. You use the tools given to you to translate."
        "If asked for multiple translations, you call the relevant tools."
    ),
    tools=[
        spanish_agent.as_tool(
            tool_name="translate_to_spanish",
            tool_description="Translate the user's message to Spanish",
        ),
        french_agent.as_tool(
            tool_name="translate_to_french",
            tool_description="Translate the user's message to French",
        ),
    ],
)

async def main():
    result = await Runner.run(orchestrator_agent, input="Say 'Hello, how are you?' in Spanish.")
    print(result.final_output)
Customizing tool-agents
The agent.as_tool function is a convenience method to make it easy to turn an agent into a tool. It doesn't support all configuration though; for example, you can't set max_turns. For advanced use cases, use Runner.run directly in your tool implementation:


@function_tool
async def run_my_agent() -> str:
    """A tool that runs the agent with custom configs"""

    agent = Agent(name="My agent", instructions="...")

    result = await Runner.run(
        agent,
        input="...",
        max_turns=5,
        run_config=...
    )

    return str(result.final_output)
Custom output extraction
In certain cases, you might want to modify the output of the tool-agents before returning it to the central agent. This may be useful if you want to:

Extract a specific piece of information (e.g., a JSON payload) from the sub-agent's chat history.
Convert or reformat the agent’s final answer (e.g., transform Markdown into plain text or CSV).
Validate the output or provide a fallback value when the agent’s response is missing or malformed.
You can do this by supplying the custom_output_extractor argument to the as_tool method:


async def extract_json_payload(run_result: RunResult) -> str:
    # Scan the agent’s outputs in reverse order until we find a JSON-like message from a tool call.
    for item in reversed(run_result.new_items):
        if isinstance(item, ToolCallOutputItem) and item.output.strip().startswith("{"):
            return item.output.strip()
    # Fallback to an empty JSON object if nothing was found
    return "{}"


json_tool = data_agent.as_tool(
    tool_name="get_data_json",
    tool_description="Run the data agent and return only its JSON payload",
    custom_output_extractor=extract_json_payload,
)
Conditional tool enabling
You can conditionally enable or disable agent tools at runtime using the is_enabled parameter. This allows you to dynamically filter which tools are available to the LLM based on context, user preferences, or runtime conditions.


import asyncio
from agents import Agent, AgentBase, Runner, RunContextWrapper
from pydantic import BaseModel

class LanguageContext(BaseModel):
    language_preference: str = "french_spanish"

def french_enabled(ctx: RunContextWrapper[LanguageContext], agent: AgentBase) -> bool:
    """Enable French for French+Spanish preference."""
    return ctx.context.language_preference == "french_spanish"

# Create specialized agents
spanish_agent = Agent(
    name="spanish_agent",
    instructions="You respond in Spanish. Always reply to the user's question in Spanish.",
)

french_agent = Agent(
    name="french_agent",
    instructions="You respond in French. Always reply to the user's question in French.",
)

# Create orchestrator with conditional tools
orchestrator = Agent(
    name="orchestrator",
    instructions=(
        "You are a multilingual assistant. You use the tools given to you to respond to users. "
        "You must call ALL available tools to provide responses in different languages. "
        "You never respond in languages yourself, you always use the provided tools."
    ),
    tools=[
        spanish_agent.as_tool(
            tool_name="respond_spanish",
            tool_description="Respond to the user's question in Spanish",
            is_enabled=True,  # Always enabled
        ),
        french_agent.as_tool(
            tool_name="respond_french",
            tool_description="Respond to the user's question in French",
            is_enabled=french_enabled,
        ),
    ],

async def main():
    context = RunContextWrapper(LanguageContext(language_preference="french_spanish"))

The is_enabled parameter accepts:

Boolean values: True (always enabled) or False (always disabled)
Callable functions: Functions that take (context, agent) and return a boolean
Async functions: Async functions for complex conditional logic
Disabled tools are completely hidden from the LLM at runtime, making this useful for:

Feature gating based on user permissions
Environment-specific tool availability (dev vs prod)
A/B testing different tool configurations
Dynamic tool filtering based on runtime state
Handling errors in function tools
When you create a function tool via @function_tool, you can pass a failure_error_function. This is a function that provides an error response to the LLM in case the tool call crashes.

By default (i.e. if you don't pass anything), it runs a default_tool_error_function which tells the LLM an error occurred.
If you pass your own error function, it runs that instead, and sends the response to the LLM.
If you explicitly pass None, then any tool call errors will be re-raised for you to handle. This could be a ModelBehaviorError if the model produced invalid JSON, or a UserError if your code crashed, etc.

from agents import function_tool, RunContextWrapper
from typing import Any

def my_custom_error_function(context: RunContextWrapper[Any], error: Exception) -> str:
    """A custom function to provide a user-friendly error message."""
    print(f"A tool call failed with the following error: {error}")
    return "An internal server error occurred. Please try again later."

@function_tool(failure_error_function=my_custom_error_function)
def get_user_profile(user_id: str) -> str:
    """Fetches a user profile from a mock API.
     This function demonstrates a 'flaky' or failing API call.
    """
    if user_id == "user_123":
        return "User profile for user_123 successfully retrieved."
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Could not retrieve profile for user_id: {user_id}. API returned an error.")
If you are manually creating a FunctionTool object, then you must handle errors inside the on_invoke_tool function.




=====



Streaming
Streaming lets you subscribe to updates of the agent run as it proceeds. This can be useful for showing the end-user progress updates and partial responses.

To stream, you can call Runner.run_streamed(), which will give you a RunResultStreaming. Calling result.stream_events() gives you an async stream of StreamEvent objects, which are described below.

Raw response events
RawResponsesStreamEvent are raw events passed directly from the LLM. They are in OpenAI Responses API format, which means each event has a type (like response.created, response.output_text.delta, etc) and data. These events are useful if you want to stream response messages to the user as soon as they are generated.

For example, this will output the text generated by the LLM token-by-token.


import asyncio
from openai.types.responses import ResponseTextDeltaEvent
from agents import Agent, Runner

async def main():
    agent = Agent(
        name="Joker",
        instructions="You are a helpful assistant.",
    )

    result = Runner.run_streamed(agent, input="Please tell me 5 jokes.")
    async for event in result.stream_events():
        if event.type == "raw_response_event" and isinstance(event.data, ResponseTextDeltaEvent):
            print(event.data.delta, end="", flush=True)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Run item events and agent events
RunItemStreamEvents are higher level events. They inform you when an item has been fully generated. This allows you to push progress updates at the level of "message generated", "tool ran", etc, instead of each token. Similarly, AgentUpdatedStreamEvent gives you updates when the current agent changes (e.g. as the result of a handoff).

For example, this will ignore raw events and stream updates to the user.


import asyncio
import random
from agents import Agent, ItemHelpers, Runner, function_tool

@function_tool
def how_many_jokes() -> int:
    return random.randint(1, 10)


async def main():
    agent = Agent(
        name="Joker",
        instructions="First call the `how_many_jokes` tool, then tell that many jokes.",
        tools=[how_many_jokes],
    )

    result = Runner.run_streamed(
        agent,
        input="Hello",
    )
    print("=== Run starting ===")

    async for event in result.stream_events():
        # We'll ignore the raw responses event deltas
        if event.type == "raw_response_event":
            continue
        # When the agent updates, print that
        elif event.type == "agent_updated_stream_event":
            print(f"Agent updated: {event.new_agent.name}")
            continue
        # When items are generated, print them
        elif event.type == "run_item_stream_event":
            if event.item.type == "tool_call_item":
                print("-- Tool was called")
            elif event.item.type == "tool_call_output_item":
                print(f"-- Tool output: {event.item.output}")
            elif event.item.type == "message_output_item":
                print(f"-- Message output:\n {ItemHelpers.text_message_output(event.item)}")
            else:
                pass  # Ignore other event types

    print("=== Run complete ===")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())



Results
When you call the Runner.run methods, you either get a:

RunResult if you call run or run_sync
RunResultStreaming if you call run_streamed
Both of these inherit from RunResultBase, which is where most useful information is present.

Final output
The final_output property contains the final output of the last agent that ran. This is either:

a str, if the last agent didn't have an output_type defined
an object of type last_agent.output_type, if the agent had an output type defined.
Note

final_output is of type Any. We can't statically type this, because of handoffs. If handoffs occur, that means any Agent might be the last agent, so we don't statically know the set of possible output types.

Inputs for the next turn
You can use result.to_input_list() to turn the result into an input list that concatenates the original input you provided, to the items generated during the agent run. This makes it convenient to take the outputs of one agent run and pass them into another run, or to run it in a loop and append new user inputs each time.

Last agent
The last_agent property contains the last agent that ran. Depending on your application, this is often useful for the next time the user inputs something. For example, if you have a frontline triage agent that hands off to a language-specific agent, you can store the last agent, and re-use it the next time the user messages the agent.

New items
The new_items property contains the new items generated during the run. The items are RunItems. A run item wraps the raw item generated by the LLM.

MessageOutputItem indicates a message from the LLM. The raw item is the message generated.
HandoffCallItem indicates that the LLM called the handoff tool. The raw item is the tool call item from the LLM.
HandoffOutputItem indicates that a handoff occurred. The raw item is the tool response to the handoff tool call. You can also access the source/target agents from the item.
ToolCallItem indicates that the LLM invoked a tool.
ToolCallOutputItem indicates that a tool was called. The raw item is the tool response. You can also access the tool output from the item.
ReasoningItem indicates a reasoning item from the LLM. The raw item is the reasoning generated.
Other information
Guardrail results
The input_guardrail_results and output_guardrail_results properties contain the results of the guardrails, if any. Guardrail results can sometimes contain useful information you want to log or store, so we make these available to you.

Raw responses
The raw_responses property contains the ModelResponses generated by the LLM.

Original input
The input property contains the original input you provided to the run method. In most cases you won't need this, but it's available in case you do.
